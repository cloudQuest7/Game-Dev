## **Project Overview**

This game is designed as a fun jumping challenge with side-scrolling mechanics. Steve automatically runs, and the player needs to jump and avoid various obstacles while the background scrolls continuously.

- **Genre**: Endless Runner / Platformer
- **Current State**: Prototype/Initial Draft
- **Goal**: Avoid obstacles and survive as long as possible!

## **Game Mechanics**
- **Player Control**: Steve runs from left to right. Players can control when he jumps.
- **Obstacles**: Avoid obstacles that spawn periodically. The game gets faster as time progresses, increasing the difficulty.
- **Scrolling Background**: The background scrolls continuously to simulate Steveâ€™s running movement.

## **Key Scripts**

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core scripts in the game:

1. **MoveLeft.cs**
   - Controls the movement of objects in the game like obstacles and ground that move from right to left to simulate the playerâ€™s movement.

2. **PlayerController.cs**
   - Handles all the player inputs (jumping, running) and interactions with the game environment.

3. **RepeatBackground.cs**
   - Manages the infinite scrolling background, resetting its position to give the impression of continuous motion.

4. **SpawnManager.cs**
   - Responsible for spawning obstacles dynamically as Steve progresses through the level.
